# Tidy Data Case Studies in R

I wrote a two series article on the concept of tidy data and tidy data principles. To demonstrate the understanding of these concepts, I did a walk through in R using the tidyr package (one of the core packages in the family of tidyverse packages).

This repository contains the R script and data sets that I used for this demonstration.
