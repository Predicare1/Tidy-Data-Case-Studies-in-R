# Tidy Data Case Studies in R

Intially, I wrote two series article on the concept of tidy data and tidy data principles. To demonstrate the understanding of these concepts, I did a walk through in R using the tidyr package (one of the core packages in the family of tidyverse packages).

Then, I wrote another article to explain the tidy data principle that: *"no cell value should contain missing values"*. In the article, I showed how to handle missing values in R using the tidyr package.

This repository contains the R script and data sets that I used for this demonstration.
